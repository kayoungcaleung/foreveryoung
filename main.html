      <h1 id="logistics">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <ul>
	 
	      <faqq>What is the dress code?</faqq><br>
	      <faqa> Our dress code is summer semi-formal. For women, we request knee length dresses or longer. Light, pastel, and floral hues are encouraged but not required. Gentlemen, please wear a light jacket and pants. Please see <a href="https://pin.it/7KiCPzDb0">here</a> here for examples! Please note that our wedding will be outdoors on a farm, with a combination of grass and gravel paths. We recommend comfortable shoes.</faqa>
      
      <br>
      
      <faqq>What is the weather going to be like?</faqq><br>
	      <faqa>Santa Rosa has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers. Daily high temperatures in June hover in the 75-85 range until 7pm; afterward it will likely be between 65-75 Fahrenheit. Expect ample drinks to help you stay cool! In addition, there will be an small indoor area (about the size of a living room) with air conditioning.</faqa>
	
      <br>
      <faqq>Is there a hotel block?</faqq><br>
      <faqa>You can reserve a hotel room in our wedding block or a bed in a shared AirBnB <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFB938IL3fOXac100btWn3z9Ml1BLKnANL8IlMtkXlM/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a>.</faqa>

      <br>
      <faqq>Can you tell me about the food and drink situation?</faqq><br>
      <faqa>Refreshments served prior to the ceremony will include light finger foods and non-alcoholic drinks. After the ceremony, we will have a champagne toast, and a bartender will serve wine at an open bar. Charcuterie and fruit plates will be available. Dinner will be served around 8pm with cake to follow.</faqa>
      <br>
      
      <faqq>What are other things to do in the area?</faqq><br>
      <faqa>Santa Rosa is located in Sonoma County, a region famous for its wineries. In addition to the numerous wineries in the area, we recommend the Charles M Schulz (Snoopy) Museum in downtown Santa Rosa just ten minutes away and Snoopy's Home Ice. Nearby Calistoga has mud baths and hot springs, which are known to locals as hidden gems.
      Additionally, here are our greater Bay Area food recommendations: Champa Garden (Thai), Pho Kim Long (pho), Kajiken (soupless ramen), Doughweime (malasadas), Hui Lau Shan (pomelo + mango sago), Devout Coffee (coffee), Mission Tasty Hut (burgers).  </faqa>

      <br>
	
      <faqq>How can I get to the venue? Will there be carpools available?</faqq><br>

      <faqa>Santa Rosa is about an hour‚Äôs drive north of San Francisco. Carpools from San Francisco, SFO Airport, or OAK Airport will likely be available for those visiting from out of town if you sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFB938IL3fOXac100btWn3z9Ml1BLKnANL8IlMtkXlM/edit?gid=23705704#gid=23705704">here</a>. Parking will be available. </faqa>

      <br>

      <faqq>Is there a gift registry?</faqq><br>
      <faqa>Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift to us, and we appreciate your support as we embark on our lives together. In lieu of a traditional registry, since we do not currently live together, we kindly request a cash (or check) donation in any amount that you are able to give in a red envelope. Red envelopes (Á¥ÖÂåÖ) are a symbol of good luck in Chinese culture, and will be provided for guests on the day of the wedding. For those who prefer to give a physical gift, we have added a few items to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFB938IL3fOXac100btWn3z9Ml1BLKnANL8IlMtkXlM/edit?gid=1392431297#gid=1392431297">registry</a>; for convenience, these can be sent to Calvin's family in the South Bay (ask us for the address and be sure to tell Calvin or Katherine as soon as you have purchased it so we can update the registry).</faqa>

      <br>
      <faqq>My question wasn't answered?</faqq><br>
      <faqa>Please contact Katherine or Calvin for any clarification! Also note the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQxG9bMtJ_kbPHvGWqpW8Vsji0Ptm5IRKuXe8svvp-0/edit?usp=sharing">FAQs that our venue provided</a> about visiting Bees N Blooms and a <a href="https://beesnblooms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FarmMap_w_FAQs_3-21-23AltTraffic.pdf">map of the site</a>.</faqa>
